## Part 1 : measurements on Arduino Bluno

The Arduino Bluno board must meet two objectives: obtaining and processing data providing by the different modules and sharing these data with a Raspberry Pi via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).   

A guide is provided in **Wiki section > Measurements with Arduino Bluno**.

## Part 2 : data sharing through BLE

The measurements and time can be sent from Arduino Bluno through Bluetooth Low Energy, and received by a Raspberry Pi 3 B+ (or other models with a BLE integrated module). The first device plays the *peripheral* role, the second one plays the *central* role.
